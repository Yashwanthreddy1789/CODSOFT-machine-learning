# machine-learning
Task 1  - MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION
-Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifierssuch as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.

Task 2 - CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
-Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a dataset containing information about credit card transactions, andexperiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
